## MERN Stack Chat App

This is a chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It utilizes the following technologies:

- Front-end: React, Formik, Material-UI, Socket.IO
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, Bcrypt, CORS, JWT

The front-end is developed with React, Formik, and Material-UI, providing a user-friendly interface. Socket.IO enables real-time communication between the client and server, allowing for instant messaging.

The back-end is built with Node.js and Express.js, implementing features such as user authentication and authorization using JWT. Bcrypt is used for password hashing and encryption, ensuring user data security. CORS allows for controlled cross-origin communication.

This MERN stack chat app provides a seamless and interactive chat experience for users.
